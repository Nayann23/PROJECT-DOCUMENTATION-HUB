## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a robust NLP pipeline that elevates classical news classification into a comprehensive analytical tool, focusing on **observability, content density awareness, and system traceability.**

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **Engine:** Multinomial Naive Bayes + TF-IDF Vectorization for high-speed, deterministic taxonomy.
- **Analytics:** Integrated Sentiment Analysis and frequency-based keyword/entity extraction.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) modernized from an initial prototype for granular state control and improved performance.
- **Frontend:** TailwindCSS & Chart.js, featuring a "Scan Initialization" workflow to simulate real-world data orchestration.
- **Persistence:** Time-bounded local retention (7 days) using browser localStorage for zero-leak privacy.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Operational Realism:** Unlike static demos, the UI features live system status indicators (Idle → Scanning → Complete) to reflect the stages of data processing latencies.
- **Hybrid Intelligence:** Surfaces secondary signals (sentiment trends and word-count density) to provide a 360-degree view of the content beyond the primary category.
- **Sample Ingestion Pipeline:** Includes a governed sample-injection system from curated sources to support consistent system evaluation and analytical testing.
