## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a robust, system-oriented NLP workflow that prioritizes **linguistic precision, negation awareness, and local feature attribution (Explainability)** through a polished analytics interface.

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **ML Engine:** Tuned **LightGBM Classifier** with TF-IDF Vectorization for multi-class sentiment categorization.
- **NLP Pipeline:** Deep linguistic preprocessing via **NLTK**, featuring POS-aware lemmatization and negation-context detection.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Custom **SHAP-style attribution logic** that surfaces local feature contribution for every prediction.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with a defensive design that includes toxic-content filtering and sample injection simulations.
- **Frontend:** TailwindCSS and Chart.js, designed as a high-fidelity "Intelligence Console" for real-time monitoring.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Neural Breakdown (XAI):** Moves beyond "black-box" predictions by surfacing token-level impact scores, allowing users to see exactly which words (e.g., "not friendly" vs "fast") drove the sentiment score.
- **Negation-Aware Intelligence:** Implements a context-aware layer to correctly handle polarity flips (e.g., "never helpful"), significantly reducing false positives compared to standard keyword-based systems.
- **Defensive Workflow Design:** Includes a sample-injection system with a built-in safety filter to demonstrate how production-style pipelines protect against toxic or malformed data inputs.
