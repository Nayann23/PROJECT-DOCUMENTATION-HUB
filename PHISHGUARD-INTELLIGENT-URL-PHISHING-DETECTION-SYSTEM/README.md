## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a robust security workflow that mitigates phishing threats by integrating **XGBoost classification** with **dynamic feature extraction** and **layered defensive heuristics**.

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **ML Engine:** Tuned **XGBoost Classifier** trained on high-entropy phishing and legitimate URL datasets.
- **Security Logic:** Multi-layer heuristics including **Typosquatting detection**, **High-Risk TLD scoring**, and **Suspicious Pattern Scanning (Regex)**.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with **SQLite-powered authentication** for secure session management and identity control.
- **Frontend:** Responsive UI built with **TailwindCSS**, featuring explainable threat scoring and real-time visualization.
- **Infrastructure:** Containerized via **Docker** for consistent environment orchestration and deployment.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Defense-in-Depth Architecture:** Emulates professional security workflows by passing URLs through an allowlist and heuristic scanners before reaching the ML inference layer, significantly reducing false positives.
- **Typosquatting Intelligence:** Features a custom detection engine for homograph substitutions and obfuscated variants (e.g., `g00gle`, `faceb00k`) of global and regional domains.
- **Privacy-First Design:** Implements a zero-log policy; URL analysis is performed locally within the session, ensuring no user data or target URLs are persisted server-side.
