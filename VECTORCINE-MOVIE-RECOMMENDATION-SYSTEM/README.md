# 🎬 VectorCine AI — Cinematic Intelligence & Vector Similarity Engine

> **VectorCine AI is a high-fidelity recommendation system that navigates high-dimensional vector spaces to surface semantic film relationships. It is architected as an internal intelligence console, emphasizing the discipline required to transition from model experimentation to a reliable system interface.**

---

## **📡 Deployment & Infrastructure Note**

> [!CAUTION]
> **Intentional Offline Status:** Due to the high memory overhead of precomputed vector artifacts (~190MB) and free-tier infrastructure constraints, the live public endpoint has been intentionally disabled to prioritize system integrity. The full stack is verified and optimized for high-memory environments (VPS/Docker/Cloud).

## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a robust content-based recommendation pipeline that prioritizes **vector similarity logic, low-latency retrieval, and IDE-inspired interaction design.**

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **Engine:** Cosine Similarity + High-Dimensional Vector Embeddings for deterministic, semantic ranking.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python 3.11) with **GDown** for secure, environment-driven model artifact delivery.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS with **Ghost Autocomplete** (IDE-inspired TAB-to-complete) and Canvas-based neural network animations.
- **DevOps:** Containerized via **Docker** with a Gunicorn production server configuration.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Interaction Governance:** Implements a "Ghost Autocomplete" system to reduce user friction, mirroring the efficiency of modern code editors.
- **Transparency & Observability:** Features a simulated **Intelligence Dashboard** that exposes vector dimensionality and similarity effectiveness, treating explainability as a core concern.
- **Architectural Pragmatism:** Intentionally utilizes a precomputed similarity matrix to ensure sub-millisecond retrieval, avoiding the overhead of real-time transformer inference while maintaining accuracy.
