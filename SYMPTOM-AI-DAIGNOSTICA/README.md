## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a sophisticated HealthTech workflow that prioritizes **input efficiency, predictive accuracy, and system-level UI design** by integrating ML inference with real-time symptom assistance.

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **ML Engine:** Random Forest Classifier trained on academic symptom–disease relationships (Mendeley Data).
- **Intelligent UX:** Context-aware **Autocomplete** (TAB-to-fill) and **Co-occurrence Recommender** for related symptoms.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) managing multi-label symptom encoding and probabilistic inference.
- **Frontend:** TailwindCSS with a custom **Glassmorphism** aesthetic, optimized for cross-device responsiveness.
- **Deployment:** Containerized via **Docker** to ensure reproducible environment orchestration.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Smart Symptom Assistance:** Implements a dynamic "Related Symptom" recommender that suggests common co-occurrences, improving input quality by guiding the user based on statistical relationships.
- **Rapid Workflow Design:** Features a "Quick-Pick" side panel for high-frequency symptoms and an inline-faded autocomplete to minimize user cognitive load.
- **Interpretable Inference:** Transforms vectorized symptom inputs into human-readable disease probability predictions with immediate UI feedback, simulating early-stage diagnostic support.
